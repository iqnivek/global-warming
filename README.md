# A guide to climate change and how to prevent it

⚠️ This is a work in progress

👉 = highly recommended

## How are we causing climate change?

* 👉 [**Climate Change: a pragmatic guide**](http://www.tmrow.com/climatechange.html) - an excellent high-level overview of climate change
* [Climate change and the 75% problem](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/My-plan-for-fighting-climate-change) - Bill Gates breaks down major sources of climate change

## How will climate change impact us?

* 👉 [**NY Times' summary of the United Nations IPCC report on the consequences of 1.5C and 2C increases in warming**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html) (4 min read)

## How can individuals help prevent climate change?

Political activism:

* [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/) - a nationwide group dedicated to lobbying for bipartisan climate change solutions.
* [A carbon tax would accelerate the adoption of every climate solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/d7rx2e/climate_change_accelerating_say_scientists/f14zb4r/) - a reddit user's breakdown of why a carbon tax is important, and how to lobby for it.

Everyday actions:

* [Buy carbon offsets and contribute to projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions](https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/) (United Nations Carbon offset program)
* [Ten simple ways to act on climate change (BBC)](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181102-what-can-i-do-about-climate-change) (6 min read)
  * Fix systemic issue by being consumer advocates for systemic improvements and renewable energy (e.g. divesting funds out of polluting activities like fossil fuel stocks)
  * Go car-free
  * Change your diet to have less meat. Cows produce lots of methane, a greenhouse gas. They eat a lot of food, which is an inefficient process. And they require lots of water, fertilizers, and land (which can come from cleared forests).
  * Fly less. A transatlantic flight can release ~1.6 tons of CO2.

## What are ways to reduce greenhouse gases from the atmosphere?

### Overviews

A fascinating guide illustrating experimental approaches to carbon removal.

👉 [**Bret Victor's "What can a technologist do about climate change?"**](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/)

* [Improve costs or scalability of wind and solar](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#production-stuff)
* [Use computation to improve power generation](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#production-computation), e.g. by using probabalistic modeling to better estimate wind capacity at a location
* [Improve the ability to distribute energy from the grid and to store it](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#moving): all energy produced in power plants must be consumed somewhere. Relying on solar and wind means that we'll need ways to store energy when there's no sun or wind out. Grid-scale energy storage is critical and current batteries don't cut it.

[**Project Drawdown**](https://www.drawdown.org) - a research organization analyzing the most viable climate change solutions. They have a [book](https://www.drawdown.org/the-book) and a [ranked list of solutions](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank).

### Clean electricity

[A critical step to reduce climate change](
https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/A-critical-step-to-reduce-climate-change) - Bill Gates talks about the three key solutions for clean electricity: improved energy storage, carbon capture storage and nuclear, and high-voltage long-distance transmission lines.

* [TerraPower](https://terrapower.com) - a Bill Gates backed company building a safe nuclear reactor that uses depleted U-238 uranium, which is currently considered nuclear waste.


### Agriculture & forestry

[We should discuss soil as much as coal](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/We-should-discuss-soil-as-much-as-coal) - Bill Gates talks about how agriculture and forestry, which contributes to 24% of greenhouse gas emissions, may be overlooked. Goes over a variety of ideas for food production with less emissions.

Companies:

* [C16 Biosciences](https://www.c16bio.com) - uses fermentation and microbes to produce a palm oil alternative. Palm oil is a $61 billion industry that has caused massive deforestation.
* [Salk](https://www.salk.edu/science/power-of-plants/) - genetically modifying plants to grow bigger root systems that absorb larger amounts of carbon and burying it in the ground in the form of suberin (cork).
* [Nori](https://nori.com/) - creating a marketplace to make it easy for companies to pay farmers for storing carbon in soil



### Carbon capture and direct-air capture

[Sucking carbon dioxide from air is cheaper than scientists thought](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05357-w) - Carbon Engineering, a direct-air capture company, published a study putting the cost of removing a tonne of CO2 from the atmosphere to be from $94 to $232.

Companies:

* [Carbon Engineering](https://carbonengineering.com) - captures CO2 from the air and turns it into gasoline/diesel/jet fuel. Based in Vancouver.
* [ClimeWorks](https://www.climeworks.com/) - captures CO2 from the air, heats it to 100C, and then collected as concentrated gas to be sold
