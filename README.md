# A guide to climate change and how to prevent it

⚠️ This is a work in progress

**Bold** = highly recommended

## How are we causing climate change?

## How will climate change impact us?

* [**NY Times' summary of the United Nations IPCC report on the consequences of 1.5C and 2C increases in warming**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html) (4 min read)

## How do we prevent climate change?

**Things individuals can do:**

* [Buy carbon offsets and contribute to projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions](https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/) (United Nations Carbon offset program)
* [Ten simple ways to act on climate change (BBC)](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181102-what-can-i-do-about-climate-change) (6 min read)
  * Fix systemic issue by being consumer advocates for systemic improvements and renewable energy (e.g. divesting funds out of polluting activities like fossil fuel stocks)
  * Go car-free
  * Change your diet to have less meat. Cows produce lots of methane, a greenhouse gas. They eat a lot of food, which is an inefficient process. And they require lots of water, fertilizers, and land (which can come from cleared forests).
  * Fly less. A transatlantic flight can release ~1.6 tons of CO2.

**Removing carbon from the atmosphere:**

* [**Y Combinator's Request for Startups around carbon removal**](http://carbon.ycombinator.com/), a fascinating guide illustrating experimental approaches
* [CO2 extraction](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8pbuqv/sucking_carbon_dioxide_from_air_is_cheaper_than/)


[**Bret Victor's "What can a technologist do about climate change?"**](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/)

* [Improve costs or scalability of wind and solar](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#production-stuff)
* [Use computation to improve power generation](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#production-computation), e.g. by using probabalistic modeling to better estimate wind capacity at a location
* [Improve the ability to distribute energy from the grid and to store it](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#moving): all energy produced in power plants must be consumed somewhere. Relying on solar and wind means that we'll need ways to store energy when there's no sun or wind out. Grid-scale energy storage is critical and current batteries don't cut it.

## Organizations to support

* [Airminers](http://www.airminers.org/) - an index of companies and projects that are trying to remove carbon from the air
* [Carbon180](https://carbon180.org) - an NGO that wants to drive carbon removal by finding economic uses for CO2.
