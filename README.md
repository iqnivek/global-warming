# A guide to climate change and how to prevent it

⚠️ This is a work in progress

**Bold** = highly recommended

## How are we causing climate change?

* [Bill Gates breaks down major sources of climate change](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/My-plan-for-fighting-climate-change)

## How will climate change impact us?

* [**NY Times' summary of the United Nations IPCC report on the consequences of 1.5C and 2C increases in warming**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html) (4 min read)

## How can individuals help prevent climate change?

* [Buy carbon offsets and contribute to projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions](https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/) (United Nations Carbon offset program)
* [Ten simple ways to act on climate change (BBC)](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181102-what-can-i-do-about-climate-change) (6 min read)
  * Fix systemic issue by being consumer advocates for systemic improvements and renewable energy (e.g. divesting funds out of polluting activities like fossil fuel stocks)
  * Go car-free
  * Change your diet to have less meat. Cows produce lots of methane, a greenhouse gas. They eat a lot of food, which is an inefficient process. And they require lots of water, fertilizers, and land (which can come from cleared forests).
  * Fly less. A transatlantic flight can release ~1.6 tons of CO2.

## What are ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere?

* [**Y Combinator's Request for Startups around carbon removal**](http://carbon.ycombinator.com/), a fascinating guide illustrating experimental approaches
* [CO2 extraction](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8pbuqv/sucking_carbon_dioxide_from_air_is_cheaper_than/)


[**Bret Victor's "What can a technologist do about climate change?"**](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/)

* [Improve costs or scalability of wind and solar](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#production-stuff)
* [Use computation to improve power generation](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#production-computation), e.g. by using probabalistic modeling to better estimate wind capacity at a location
* [Improve the ability to distribute energy from the grid and to store it](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#moving): all energy produced in power plants must be consumed somewhere. Relying on solar and wind means that we'll need ways to store energy when there's no sun or wind out. Grid-scale energy storage is critical and current batteries don't cut it.

## Organizations to support

Organizations

* [Airminers](http://www.airminers.org/) - an index of companies and projects that are trying to remove carbon from the air
* [Carbon180](https://carbon180.org) - an NGO that wants to drive carbon removal by finding economic uses for CO2.
* [Impossible Labs](https://impossiblelabs.io) - a consultancy that explores business opportunities in climate change

Indexes

* [Geoengineering monitor](https://map.geoengineeringmonitor.org/) - a map of organizations worldwide working on greenhouse gas removal, solar radiation management, and weather modification. A nice way to discover common groups of focus areas such as carbon capture, direct air capture, ocean fertilization, and so on.


Carbon removal startups

* [Carbon Engineering](https://carbonengineering.com) - captures CO2 from the air and turns it into gasoline/diesel/jet fuel. Based in Vancouver.
* [ClimeWorks](https://www.climeworks.com/) - captures CO2 from the air, heats it to 100C, and then collected as concentrated gas to be sold
* [Solidia](https://www.solidiatech.com/) - uses a curing process to produce concrete using CO2 instead of water. Concrete production accounts for 5-7% of CO2 emissions
* [Salk](https://www.salk.edu/science/power-of-plants/) - genetically modify plants to grow bigger root systems that absorb larger amounts of carbon and burying it in the ground in the form of suberin (cork).
* [Novonutrients](https://www.novonutrients.com/novonutrients-at-indiebio-demo-day) - turn industrial CO2 emissions into protein, useful for feeding fish and other animals
* [Carbon Clean Solutions Limited](https://carboncleansolutions.com/technology/process-technology/profile/cdrmax-process) - captures CO2 from industrial flue gases
* [Saratoga Energy](http://www.saratoga-energy.com/) - turning CO2 into carbon nanotubes, which are an essential material in lithium-ion batteries. YC startup.
* [Mango Materials](http://mangomaterials.com/) - turn methane into biodegradable plastic, which turns back into methane in a landfill. Based in SF.
* [Prometheus](https://www.prometheusfuels.com/) - remove CO2 from air and turn it into gasoline. YC '19 startup.
* [Nori](https://nori.com/) - making it straightforward for companies to pay farmers for storing carbon in soil
* [Charm Industrial](https://www.charmindustrial.com/about) - producing hydrogen from crops instead of steam methane reformation (responsible for 2% of CO2) emissions. Based in SF.
* [Smart Stones](http://smartstones.nl/) - olivine weathering to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere


## Carbon science and glossary

Term | Definition
---- | ----------
Biochar | A charcoal-like solid substance that can be used to keep carbon in soil for thousands of years, and help improve soil quality.
Carbon sequestration | The process of capturing and long-term storage of atmospheric CO2 to mitigate global warming.
Feedstock | TODO
Gasification | Process of converting organic or fossil fuels into carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Reacts the material at >700C with oxygen and/or steam.
